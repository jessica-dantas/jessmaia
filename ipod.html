<h2> Well.<br>
  <br><br><br><br>
  I was young and didn't undertand <br>
  That this would hurt your feelings.<br>
  <br><br><br><br>
  So I have a really good excuse <br>
  before my apology.<br>

  <br><br><br>
  ALL MY FRIENDS HAVE IPOD TOUCHES <br>
  WHY COULDNT I HAVE ONE?<br>
  <br><br><br>

I shouldn't have cried during christmas <br>
  and ruined it for everyone <br>

     <br><br>
  But I was nine <br>
  and the perfect age<br>
  <br><br><br>
but I understand how that's stupid now..
  <br><br><br>
  I'm Sorry.. <br><br>
