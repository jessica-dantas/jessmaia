I was innocent! <br>
I didn't know what a "Lie" was!<br>
But I did it because<br>
My little human senses weren't there!<br>

 Okay,<br>
 During my 6th birthday party<br>
 You asked if I were the one who broke your glasses<br>
 Did you know it was me? <br>
 Because when I said no..<br>
 You kept insisting!!<br>
 Even though I was lying <br>
