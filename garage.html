<h2> Okay. <br>
  <br><br>
  Maybe you remember this- <br>

  before I went in the garage, <br>
  you made me lunch. <br><br><br>

  <br><br>
  That lunch specifically was that <br>
  peanut butter bread I didn’t like.<br>
   So I had a ton of orange juice.<br>
   <br><br>

<br>
  My brother was taking a shower while I was watching <br>
  powerpuff girls and I really couldn’t wait..<br>
<br><br>
I know I should’ve waited..<br> <br><br> <br><br>

But wait.
<br><br><br><br>
LET ME EXPLAIN.<br>
<br><br>
I thought it was going to be an okay idea because <br>
in my mind I thought pee was like water..<br>
<br><br>
You spill…  it dries...it goes away.<br>
<br><br>
I didn’t think it was going to be that smelly.<br>
<br><br>
I’m sorry I peed in the garage.<br>
