  <p>My name is Jessica Dantas!<br><br>
  <br> Born and raised in Goi√°s - Brazil, Jess Maia grew up speaking Portuguese up to the age of thirteen. <br>
  It is her global sensibility coupled with her passion for storytelling that gives her a unique voice.<br>
   Her student films capture her individuality as an artist generally through intimate shots of locations and people.<br>
   While exploring different mediums and using various materials to experiment with, she creates thought provoking and <br>
   powerful compositions that reflects her inner voice. She has great experience in editing and cinematography as well<br>
    as being the recipient of numerous film awards. She is now a second year student at Parsons School of Design in <br>
    Manhattan and is seeking opportunities within the filmmaking industry.<br></p>
